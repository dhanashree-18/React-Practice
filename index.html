Above the 2 scripts are added which are react CDN links (Content Delivery Network).

1] <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>

- It's a React core library, contains JS code written by FB developers.
- This file contains the logic for defining and managing components, hooks and React reconciliation algorithm.
- Provides APIs for crreating elements (React.createElement) and managing state using useState,useEffect etc.
- does not deal with the React DOM.

2] <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

- It loads React's DOM library companion to React for web specific rendering.
- It provides API to render React components like ReactDOM.createRoot.
- manages the updates to the DOM based on the changes made to props and state within components.
- Targets the browser environment (DOM rendering).

React: Handles the logic and structure of your application.

ReactDOM: Focuses on rendering that logic and structure to the DOM in the browser. 
Both are essential for building and rendering React applications in a web environment.
